## Pieby Chess Engine

I started this project with Matt because I wanted to have an engine to call my own, one in a variant that doesn't have nearly as much support, neither in infrastructure for the developers nor theory for players. This engine is still a huge WIP, so updating the README beyond this will have to wait.
